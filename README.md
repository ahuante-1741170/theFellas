# Project Proposal

## Project Description

## Technical Description
We will be reading in our data through an **API**, which will require the httr and jsonlite libraries. Since the API separates its data into many different dataframes, our initial stages of data wrangling will deal with _joining_ and synchronizing these different datasets. This will allow us to see the relationships between geography, threats, habitats, endangerment, and many more variables across the different species in our data. We then hope to use this information to drive an _interactive_ Shiny app. This app will include **plots** created through the ggplot2 and plotly libraries and an interactive **map** that utilizes ggmap and leaflet.
